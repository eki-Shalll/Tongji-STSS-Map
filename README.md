# Tongji STSS-Map Dataset

### Overview
The Tongji STSS-Map dataset is constructed using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone equipped with the ZENMUSE L1 payload. It features high-resolution images and high positional accuracy, supported by RTK. The images are captured in a nadir view at equal time intervals, with black-and-white markers placed as Ground Control Points (GCPs) to ensure precise mapping.
