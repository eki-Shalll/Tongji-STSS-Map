# Tongji STSS-Map Dataset

### Overview
The Tongji STSS-Map dataset is constructed using a DJI Matrice 300 RTK drone equipped with the ZENMUSE L1 payload. It features high-resolution images and high positional accuracy, supported by RTK. The images are captured in a nadir view at equal time intervals, with black-and-white markers placed as Ground Control Points (GCPs) to ensure precise mapping.

### Dataset Details
- **Drone Model**: DJI Matrice 300 RTK  
- **Payload**: ZENMUSE L1  
- **Resolution**: High-resolution imagery (5472 × 3648)  
- **Positional Accuracy**: High accuracy with RTK support  
- **Ground Control Points (GCPs)**: Nine black-and-white markers (30 × 30 cm)  
- **Data Type**: Images captured at equal time intervals  
- **GCP Measurement**: Coordinates measured using RTK GPS  
- **Location**: Tongji-campus, Shanghai  
- **Images Used**: 350  
- **RTK Support**: Yes  
- **Height**: 100 m  
- **Overlap (front)**: 80%  
- **Overlap (side)**: 66%  
- **B/H ratio (front)**: 0.2  
- **Shooting Mode**: Time Interval

**Note**: The base-to-height ratio (B/H) for both front and side is set to 0.2 because the task involves UAVs with equal exposure times, 

This explanation should help clarify the reasoning behind the base-to-height ratio settings.

### Intended Use
This dataset can be used for:
- Benchmarking real-time aerial mapping systems
- Comparative analysis of Ground Control Points
- Supporting future research and development in geospatial technologies

### Availability
The dataset will be publicly available soon on [GitHub](https://github.com/eki-Shalll).
